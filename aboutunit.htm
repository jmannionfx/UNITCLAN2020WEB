		[ MESSAGE FROM UNIT LEADER ]

	<div id="e6" class="cc19">
		ABOUT THE CLAN
	</div>
	<div id="e5" class="cc20">
		UNIT Clan was founded in 2017 with the goal of being a social group for like minded individuals who wanted to play as part of a team but were missing some key ingrediants to make it to the big leagues - "also the banter was mighty."<br> 
		<br> 
		After the UNIT leadership had changed hands a vision began to form between its long term members. A vision of planning for a future of prosperity and lineage that would put UNIT on the map for Professional Sports Gaming & FPTs Shooters. Since the launch of PUBG in March 2017 on Xbox this has been our platform of choice and with the development of the PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Ranked System being launched in May 2020 it has been a unique opportunity to develop and showcase the clan's skills to the market on social media.<br> 
		<br> 
		Presently in 2020 there has been a focus & drive to develop our current roster of players, and scoping new talent with 4 new pro players joining the clan in 2020. Local League games have been flooded with success with wins at Clan 10 man custom games. But with the Ranked and ESports games launching this year - this will give UNIT another platform for success in 2020 & the beginning of 2021.

		THE PLAYERS

	<div id="e3" class="cc20">
		UNIT is made up of 14 players worldwide with locations in Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, France & the United States. 2020 saw a massive spike in competitive gameplay and UNIT are capitalizing on that with continuous team competitive play at One Player, Duos, 4 Man Squad & 10 man Clan matches.<br> 
		<br> 
		As our roster is diversified between players of different playing styles this has allowed UNIT to prepare better for competitive competition and plan gameplays against top teir teams.
