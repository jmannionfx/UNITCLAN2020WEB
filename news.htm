		As 2020 progressed a discussion was had in relation to the best way to communicate with our Community. A decision was made to create an open Facebook Page for our Clan Members, Fans, and Followers to facilitate that requirement. In May of 2020 works began on bringing some historical content over to a visual platform for our community to better follow UNIT's Trials and Tribulations along with our Successes. Therefore a Facebook page and Youtube Channel were created. <br> 
		If you wish to follow us on both please click on the Facebook and Youtube channel icons on this tab.<br> 
		For more information please feel free to contact us through our contact page.<br> 
		Thanks again to our family and friends who have supported us in our endeavors and the UNIT Clan Members for their massive involvement in building a community with UNIT.
